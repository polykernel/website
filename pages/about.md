Hello!

My name is Tony but I usually go with the handle `polykernel` online.

I am a Computer Science student at Queen's University interested in distributed computing, compilers, and functional programming.

I am also passionate about mathematics and enjoy problem solving. Through high school, I have devoted much time to studying data structures and algorithms as well as solving problems on various programming contest platforms. I plan to continue these endaevors and keep exploring the fascinating world of thereotical computer science.
