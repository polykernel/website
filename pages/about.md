## About me

Hello! My name is Tony but I usually go with the handle `polykernel` online.

I am a third-year undergraduate student in the Computing, Mathematics and Analytics (COMA) specialization at Queen's University. My interests span the realms of both mathematics and computer science.

On the computer science side, I am fascinated by the functional programming paradigm, and the idea of modelling programs/computation mathematically. On the mathematics side, I am passionate about algebraic geometry, algebraic topology and combinatorics.
