title: Hello World

Today, I finally set up my website using [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll).
I have never used Haskell for a project before so this will be a good exercise
to get familiar with the Haskell ecosystem. I am also not well versed in web
development so I am  starting out simple with hand-written html/css + the
default Hakyll templates.

In the future, I will add more content to the website and publish some of my
writings.
